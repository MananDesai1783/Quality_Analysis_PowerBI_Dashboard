# Quality Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## Objective
The primary objective of this Power BI dashboard is to analyze and derive insights from a dataset containing various features related to tasks, samples, defects, errors, and employee information within a company. Company operates across multiple departments, each responsible for executing various tasks critical to the company's operations. These tasks encompass a wide range of activities, from production processes to administrative functions. However, the company faces challenges in maintaining consistent task quality and efficiency, as evidenced by varying defect rates and error occurrences across departments and employee teams.

## Analysis Objectives
1. Task Performance Analysis:
Evaluate the frequency and types of tasks performed over time. Identify trends in task completion rates and variations across departments and auditors.

2. Defect and Error Analysis:
Investigate the relationship between defects, errors, and task types. Determine which tasks are more prone to defects and errors. Assess the impact of defects and errors on overall productivity.

3. Employee Productivity and Performance:
Analyze employee performance based on task completion rates, defects, and errors. Identify high-performing employees and areas for improvement.

4. Managerial Oversight:
Evaluate the effectiveness of managers in overseeing tasks and addressing defects and errors. Assess managerial responsiveness to issues identified during tasks.

5. Departmental Efficiency:
Compare the performance and efficiency of different departments based on task completion rates, defects, and errors. Identify departments that may require additional resources or process improvements.

6. Auditor Performance:
Assess the performance of auditors in identifying defects and errors during tasks. Determine whether certain auditors consistently perform better than others.
